# Chapter: Current Status and Key Statistics of Public Health in India

## 1. **Introduction**

India’s public health landscape is characterized by a complex interplay of progress and challenges. The country has made significant strides in reducing the prevalence of communicable diseases, improving maternal and child health, and increasing life expectancy. However, it continues to face substantial public health challenges, including the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), health inequities, and the need for a more robust health infrastructure. This chapter provides an overview of the current status of public health in India and presents key statistics to highlight the health outcomes, challenges, and opportunities.

## 2. **Overview of Health Indicators**

India’s public health status can be assessed using several key health indicators, including life expectancy, maternal and child health, the burden of diseases, and health system capacity.

- **Life Expectancy**: The average life expectancy in India has increased significantly over the decades. As of 2024, the average life expectancy at birth is around 70 years, with women generally outliving men. This improvement reflects progress in healthcare access, disease control, and better living conditions.

- **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**: The IMR has decreased from 47 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2010 to approximately 28 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. This decline is attributed to improved maternal and child health services, increased immunization coverage, and better nutrition.

- **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)**: The MMR in India has also seen a decline, dropping from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-2016 to about 113 per 100,000 live births in 2024. This improvement is due to enhanced access to prenatal care, skilled birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care.

## 3. **Burden of Communicable Diseases**

Communicable diseases continue to pose a significant public health challenge in India, although there has been considerable progress in reducing their burden.

- **Tuberculosis (TB)**: India accounts for approximately one-fourth of the global TB burden. In 2024, the incidence of TB is estimated to be around 2.1 million cases per year. The government’s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) and the aim to eliminate TB by 2025 have led to increased case detection and treatment success rates.

- **HIV/AIDS**: India has the third-largest HIV epidemic in the world. As of 2024, an estimated 2.1 million people live with HIV in India, with a declining trend in new infections due to effective prevention and treatment strategies under the National AIDS Control Program (NACP).

- **Malaria**: Malaria remains a public health issue in certain regions, particularly in tribal and rural areas. In 2024, India reported approximately 5.5 million malaria cases. However, there has been a notable reduction in malaria cases due to intensified vector control measures and increased use of rapid diagnostic tests.

- **Dengue and Other Vector-Borne Diseases**: Dengue outbreaks are recurrent in India, with seasonal peaks. In 2024, there were around 1.3 million reported cases of dengue. Efforts to control vector-borne diseases include public awareness campaigns, mosquito control measures, and early diagnosis and treatment.

## 4. **Rising Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)**

India is experiencing an epidemiological transition with an increasing burden of NCDs, which are now the leading cause of mortality and morbidity.

- **Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)**: CVDs are the leading cause of death in India, accounting for nearly 28% of all deaths in 2024. Risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are on the rise due to lifestyle changes, urbanization, and aging populations.

- **Diabetes**: India has the second-highest number of people with diabetes in the world, estimated at over 77 million in 2024. The prevalence of diabetes is rising in both urban and rural areas, posing significant public health and economic challenges.

- **Cancer**: Cancer is a growing concern, with an estimated 1.3 million new cancer cases diagnosed annually. The most common types include breast, cervical, lung, and oral cancers. The increasing cancer burden is attributed to factors like tobacco use, lifestyle changes, and aging.

- **Chronic Respiratory Diseases**: Chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, affect a large segment of the population. Air pollution, smoking, and occupational exposures are significant risk factors contributing to the prevalence of these diseases.

- **Mental Health**: Mental health disorders are increasingly recognized as a significant public health concern in India. Approximately 150 million people in India are estimated to need mental health care, but only a small fraction receives adequate treatment due to stigma, lack of awareness, and inadequate mental health infrastructure.

## 5. **Maternal and Child Health**

Maternal and child health has been a priority for India’s public health system, leading to notable improvements in key indicators.

- **Immunization Coverage**: The immunization coverage in India has improved significantly, with the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) achieving over 90% coverage for most vaccines in 2024. The Mission Indradhanush initiative has been instrumental in reaching underserved populations.

- **Nutrition**: Despite progress, malnutrition remains a significant challenge, particularly among children under five. The prevalence of stunting (low height-for-age) is around 34%, while wasting (low weight-for-height) affects about 17% of children. Programs like the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and the National Nutrition Mission (Poshan Abhiyaan) aim to address malnutrition.

- **Maternal Health Services**: Access to maternal health services, including antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care, has improved, contributing to a reduction in maternal mortality. However, disparities persist, particularly in rural and marginalized communities.

## 6. **Health System Capacity and Infrastructure**

India’s health system capacity and infrastructure have grown, but challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to quality health services.

- **Health Workforce**: India has made progress in increasing the number of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and allied health workers. However, there are disparities in the distribution of the health workforce, with rural and remote areas facing shortages. The doctor-to-population ratio in India is approximately 1:1,445, below the WHO-recommended ratio of 1:1,000.

- **Health Infrastructure**: The availability of healthcare facilities has improved, with increased numbers of Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Community Health Centers (CHCs), and District Hospitals. However, infrastructure gaps persist, particularly in rural areas where health facilities often lack adequate equipment, supplies, and staffing.

- **Health Financing**: Public health expenditure in India remains low, at around 1.5% of GDP, compared to the global average of 5.9%. High out-of-pocket expenditures account for over 60% of total health expenditures, leading to financial barriers to access and catastrophic health spending for many households.

- **Digital Health and Technology**: The adoption of digital health technologies has accelerated, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, digital health records, and mobile health applications are increasingly used to improve access to health services and enhance health system efficiency.

## 7. **Public Health Challenges and Opportunities**

While India has made significant progress in public health, several challenges remain:

- **Health Inequities**: Disparities in health outcomes persist across different socio-economic groups, geographic regions, and genders. Marginalized populations, including tribal communities, migrants, and the urban poor, often face barriers to accessing health services.

- **Epidemiological Transition**: The dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases requires a more integrated and comprehensive approach to health care, with a focus on both prevention and management.

- **Environmental and Occupational Health**: Air pollution, water contamination, and occupational hazards are significant public health issues, particularly in urban and industrial areas. Addressing these requires multi-sectoral collaboration and strengthened regulatory frameworks.

- **Health System Strengthening**: Building a resilient health system that can respond effectively to emerging health challenges, including pandemics, is crucial. This includes enhancing health infrastructure, workforce capacity, and health information systems.

- **Community Engagement and Health Literacy**: Increasing community participation in health promotion and disease prevention activities and improving health literacy are essential for achieving better health outcomes.

## 8. **Conclusion**

The current status of public health in India reflects a dynamic landscape of progress and challenges. While significant achievements have been made in improving health indicators and expanding healthcare coverage, substantial efforts are still required to address the persistent health disparities, the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, and the need for a more robust and equitable health system. Moving forward, a comprehensive approach that integrates health promotion, disease prevention, and health system strengthening, supported by adequate financing and community engagement, will be crucial in improving public health outcomes in India.
